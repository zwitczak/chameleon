# CHAMELEON - A hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Using Dynamic Modeling
Chameleon algorithm uses two-phase approach to determine clusters.

### Data Modeling


### Phase I
During phase I, a graph partitioning algorithm is used to divide the data set into a set of individual clusters. `MinSize` param is given to set the minimum number of vertices in each sub-cluster.
### Phase II
During phase II, an agglomerative hierarchical mining algorithm is used to merge the clusters.
